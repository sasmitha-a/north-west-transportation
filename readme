Transportation problem is an optimization problem in operations research, logistics, supply chain management and more.
It involves finding the most efficient way to transport goods from a set of sources to set of destinations while minimizing the cost involved or maximizing the total profit. Our project focuses on solving the transportation problem using the method of North West Corner Rule.
The objective is to optimize the allocation while considering all the given parameters such as, supply, demand, and costs. North West corner rule provides an initial feasible solution for transportation problems. North west corner rule works by allocating values from the northwest corner of the matrix and repeating the same for the rest of the matrix until all demands and supplies are met. 
We have used python and streamlit in our project. We input the relevant data that is needed to calculate the optimal solution such as, demand, supply and transportation costs. Then we apply optimization techniques to obtain the basic feasible solution.
