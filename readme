# Transportation Problem Solver
Transportation Problem Solver is an optimization project in operations research, logistics, and supply chain management. The goal is to find the most efficient way to transport goods from a set of sources to a set of destinations while minimizing costs or maximizing total profit. This project focuses on solving the transportation problem using the North West Corner Rule.

## Overview
The North West Corner Rule is a method that provides an initial feasible solution for transportation problems. It works by allocating values from the northwest corner of the matrix and repeating the process for the rest of the matrix until all demands and supplies are met.

## Objective
Our objective is to optimize the allocation considering given parameters such as supply, demand, and transportation costs. We use Python and Streamlit for the implementation.

## How it Works

1. **Input Data:** Input relevant data needed to calculate the optimal solution, including demand, supply, and transportation costs.

2. **Optimization Techniques:** Apply optimization techniques to obtain the basic feasible solution.

3. **North West Corner Rule:** Utilize the North West Corner Rule to allocate values and solve the transportation problem.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
